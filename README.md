# BirkelBot Battlebot Repo
This repository is for the code related to Matt Birkel's Battlebot for the Combotics competition held annually at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

### Folder Structure
* Robot - This is robot side code. For now this should largely be arduino code for the arduino on board the robot.
* DriverStation - This is the operator side code. This is the code that runs on a driverstation computer.
* Arduino_Calibration_Stuff - This is a folder for a tool to use the arduino to calibrate ESC's
